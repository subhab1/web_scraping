# web_scraping challenge
## Background:
The goal of this project was to get familiarize with web scraping, modeling, engineering, and exploring the scraped data, which was used to uncover various data facts about Mars. The project is also divided into two parts. The first half of the project focuses on identifying the elements and scraping the mars news article page using chrome Devtools.It was then followed by extracting titles and preview text from the news article that was scrapped. In the second half, using chrome Devtools, the HTML table was scraped and elements were identified, a panda Dataframe was created using scraping techniques for further analysis. Various graphs were modelled describing the temperature situation in Mars and its affecting in predcting the Martian year.

## Conclusion:
By using several Python libraries/modules, including Pandas, Splinter, Selenium, Chrome DevTools, Beautiful Soup, and Matplotlib, we were able to explore the climate trends, estimate the Martian seasons and year, and deliver the required visualizations.
